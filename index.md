unphased.ai is an umbrella project for coupled-oscillator-based optimization solvers.

Our core project is [DIMPLE: Digital Ising Machines from Programable Logic, Easily](https://github.com/zbelateche/digial-ising)! It's the first asynchronous oscillator-based solver that can be deployed on FPGAs. With all-to-all coupling and a state-of-the-art number of spins, DIMPLE is a great platform for prototyping new applications that leverage oscillator-based solvers.

We also develop [a fork of the Simulated Bifurcation package](https://github.com/zbelateche/simulated-bifurcation-ising/tree/main), enabling users to program DIMPLE using PyTorch. By making DIMPLE easy to use, this package lets users without hardware expertise build new algorithms powered by oscillator-based solvers.

We have a [Discord community](https://discord.gg/bkjgP5CY4G) as well -- if you're interested in this technology, you should join the conversation! As new projects spring up that leverage DIMPLE for different applications, they'll be listed here. 

Iâ€™m also looking into ways to help anybody easily run workloads on these systems for a low price! That may take the form of a cloud service, or potentially a devkit. If you're interested, join the Discord to provide some feedback and help us make that a reality!

I also personally blog about DIMPLE, among other things, at [zach.be](https://www.zach.be)!
