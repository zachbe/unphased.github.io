unphased.ai is an umbrella project for coupled-oscillator-based combinatorial optimization solvers.

Our core project is [DIMPLE: Digital Ising Machines from Programable Logic, Easily](https://github.com/zbelateche/digial-ising)! It's the first asynchronous oscillator-based solver that can be deployed on FPGAs. With all-to-all coupling and a state-of-the-art number of spins, DIMPLE is a great platform for prototyping new applications that leverage oscillator-based solvers.

We also develop [a fork of the Simulated Bifurcation package](https://github.com/zbelateche/simulated-bifurcation-ising/tree/main), enabling users to program DIMPLE using PyTorch. By making DIMPLE easy to use, this package lets users without hardware expertise build new algorithms powered by oscillator-based solvers.

We have a [Discord community](https://discord.gg/e6cbRuMb7p) as well -- if you're interested in this technology, you should join the conversation! As new projects spring up that leverage DIMPLE for different applications, they'll be listed here. 

If there’s interest, I’m looking into launching a cloud service to let anybody easily run workloads on these systems for a low price. If you'd want to use a system like that, please email me at *zachbela (at) alumni.stanford.edu* or DM me on Twitter *(at) blip_tm*. I also personally blog about DIMPLE, among other things, at [zach.be](zach.be)!
